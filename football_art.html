        <!-- Article Content -->
        <article style="margin-top: 40px;">
          <p>Football, known as soccer in some regions, is more than just a sport; it’s a global phenomenon that unites
            millions of fans and players worldwide. With its origins tracing back centuries and evolving into its modern
            form, football captivates audiences with its dynamic gameplay, strategic depth, and rich history.</p>

          <h2>Number of Players</h2>
          <p>Football is played between two teams of eleven players each, totaling twenty-two players on the field at
            any given time. Each team consists of ten outfield players and one goalkeeper. The roles of these players
            are pivotal in both offensive and defensive strategies. Players are strategically positioned across the
            field in formations that vary depending on the team's tactics and style of play.</p>

          <h2>Strategy of the Game</h2>
          <p>The strategy of football revolves around teamwork, tactical formations, and skillful execution of
            techniques such as passing, dribbling, and shooting. Teams aim to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents
            through coordinated attacks, solid defense, and effective use of set pieces like corners and free kicks.
            Coaches and managers play a crucial role in devising strategies, analyzing opponents' weaknesses, and
            maximizing their team's strengths to achieve success on the field.</p>

          <h2>Team Dynamics</h2>
          <p>Football is fundamentally a team game where success depends on the collective efforts of players working
            together on the field. Communication, understanding of teammates' movements, and adherence to tactical
            instructions are vital for achieving victory. Players must coordinate their actions seamlessly, anticipate
            each other's moves, and maintain cohesion throughout the match to overcome challenges posed by the opposing
            team.</p>

          <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
          <p>Football is played on a rectangular field with goals at each end. The objective is to score by putting the
            ball into the opponent's goal, using any part of the body except for the hands and arms (except for the
            goalkeeper within their penalty area). Key rules include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Offside:</strong> A player is offside if they are nearer to their opponent's goal line than both
              the ball and the second last opponent when the ball is played to them.</li>
            <li><strong>Fouls and Misconduct:</strong> Includes actions such as kicking an opponent, tripping, or
              handling the ball deliberately. Referees enforce these rules, issuing yellow and red cards for misconduct.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The game is played in two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute
              halftime break.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
          <p>Football's origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations like China and Greece, where similar ball
            games were played. The modern rules of football were formalized in England during the mid-19th century,
            leading to its rapid spread and popularity across Europe and beyond. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930
            and held every four years, stands as the pinnacle of international football, showcasing the world's best
            teams and players. Other prestigious tournaments include the UEFA European Championship, Copa America, and
            continental competitions such as the AFC Asian Cup and the CONCACAF Gold Cup.</p>

          <h2>Records and Statistics</h2>
          <p>Football boasts a rich tapestry of records and statistics that highlight the achievements of its players
            and teams. Pelé, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, holds the record for the
            most goals scored in FIFA World Cup tournaments, with 77 goals in official matches. Lionel Messi and
            Cristiano Ronaldo have set numerous records in European club competitions, including the UEFA Champions
            League, demonstrating their unparalleled skill and consistency at the highest level of the sport.</p>

          <h2>Global Reach</h2>
          <p>Football transcends borders and is embraced by virtually every country worldwide. Major footballing nations
            include Brazil, known for its flair and five World Cup titles; Germany, renowned for its efficiency and four
            World Cup wins; Argentina, home to legendary players like Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi; Spain, celebrated
            for its possession-based style; and England, where modern football rules were codified. Beyond these
            powerhouse nations, football is played passionately in countries across Asia, Africa, North and South
            America, and Europe, reflecting its universal appeal and cultural significance on a global scale.</p>
